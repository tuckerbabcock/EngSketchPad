		A note on EG_setTessFace and vertex renumbering


	During the execution for EG_setTessFace the vertices that are input
will go through renumbering. This is because there is an internal assumption
that the first suite of coordinates represent the Edge tessellation ordered
by the Loops found in the Face. This is usually fine, but there are 
circumstances that you may need to know the mapping, so that later you can
find specific a specific vertex. This can be reverse engineered by 
maintaining the initial triangle list, calling EG_getTessFace (after the 
invocation of EG_setTessFace) and using the triangles to construct the
index mapping. To state it in another way: the triangle order is fixed but
the list of vertices has been rearranged.
